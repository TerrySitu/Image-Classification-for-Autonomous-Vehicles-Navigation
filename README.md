# Image-Classification-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-Navigation
In this project, I implemented and compared 4 simple yet powerful classification algorithms on CIFAR 10 data set, which contains 60000 color images related to motor vehicles. 

I achieved misclassification rate as low as 3.46% without applying complex artificial neural network models.
